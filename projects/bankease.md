# BankEase - High-Performance Banking Engine

**BankEase** is a banking simulation engine optimized for raw I/O throughput, built to demonstrate advanced systems programming concepts in C++.

### Key Achievements

- **Performance Optimization:** Replaced standard text serialization with **Custom Binary File I/O**, achieving **300% faster read/write operations** for account transactions compared to standard methods.
- **Architecture:** Architected using **SOLID principles** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The banking logic is fully decoupled from the interface, allowing for seamless feature expansion.
- **Security & Persistence:** Implemented persistent data storage via binary handling to ensure financial records are stored securely and remain accessible across sessions without the risks of plain-text data loss.
