# Terminal Portfolio - Interactive CLI Interface

**Terminal Portfolio** is a performance-first personal website designed to emulate a Linux command-line interface directly in the browser. Built entirely without frameworks to demonstrate core JavaScript proficiency.

### Key Achievements

- **Zero-Dependency Architecture:** Engineered using **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+) to maximize load speed and minimize bundle size, proving deep understanding of the DOM without relying on React or Vue.
- **Command System Logic:** Implemented a custom command parser with **Tab Autocomplete**, **Command History** (using array manipulation for Up/Down arrow navigation), and fuzzy matching logic.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Configured manifest and service workers to allow the application to be installed natively on devices, functioning offline with a Linux-style boot sequence.
- **Optimization:** Achieved 100/100 Lighthouse performance scores by eliminating render-blocking resources and using semantic HTML for accessibility.
